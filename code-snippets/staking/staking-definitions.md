Some important parameters to understand related to the staking system in Moonbeam include:

-  **Collators** — block producers. They collect transactions from users and produce state transition proofs for the Relay Chain to validate. Have a stake in the network that get slashed if they misbehave
-  **Nominators** — token holders who stake tokens vouching for specific collators. Any user that holds a minimum amount of tokens as [free balance](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-accounts#balance-types)) can become a nominator
-  **Minimum nomination stake** — is the minimum amount of total tokens staked a user needs to have to be in the set of nominators
-  **Minimum nomination** — once a user is in the set of nominators, it is the minimum amount of tokens to nominate other collators
-  **Maximumm nominators per collator** — maximum number of nominators a collator can have
-  **Maximumm collators per nominator** — maximum number of collators a nominator can nominate
-  **Round** — number of blocks in a round. Important parameter for reward distribution
-  **Bond duration** — number of rounds that the staking rewards are delayed
