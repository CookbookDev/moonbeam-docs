## Introduction {: #introduction } 

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the Hardhat development environment. We'll walk through each of the steps in detail, including deployment, testing, and mainnet forking. This tutorial assumes that you already have Hardhat installed and have used it before. If you don't yet have Hardhat installed on your machine or this is your first time exploring Hardhat, it's recommended that you start with [this introduction to Hardhat](/builders/build/eth-api/dev-env/hardhat/){target=_blank}.
