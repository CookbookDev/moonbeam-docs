#Welcome to Moonbeam

This site provides documentation for Moonbeam, a smart contract parachain on the Polkadot network.  Here, you'll find both high-level and technical information for developers, collators, end users, and other Moonbeam network participants.

This site will grow and be refined over time as Moonbeam is developed.  We welcome you to join the Moonbeam community and contribute to this site and to the project.


##What is Moonbeam? 
Moonbeam is a developer-oriented blockchain that strives to provide compatibility with the existing Ethereum developer toolchain and network.  It does this by providing a full EVM implementation, a Web3-compatible API, and bridges that connect Moonbeam to existing Ethereum networks.  This allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes.

Moonbeam will also be a parachain on the Polkadot network. That means that it will get shared security from the Polkadot relay chain and will be able to integrate with other chains that are connected to Polkadot (once that functionality is available on Polkadot).
