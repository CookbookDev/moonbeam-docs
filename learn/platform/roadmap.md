# Roadmap

Moonbeam is still being actively developed. 

In September 2020, we launched our [TestNet](/learn/platform/networks/overview/). Since then we have performed significants upgrades on almost a monthly basis. You can check the milestones achieved by each update in their corresponding [release notes](/learn/platform/networks/moonbase/#release-notes).

In June 2021, Moonriver went [live on Kusama](https://moonbeam.network/announcements/moonriver-launch-kusama/), making it the first live production level blockchain within the Moonbeam Network.

In December 2021, Moonbeam went [live on Polkadot](https://moonbeam.network/announcements/moonbeam-now-producing-blocks-polkadot/), as one of the first parachains in the ecosystem.

### Interoperability

Interoperability is and will continue to be a high-priority item, in particular XCM development. For more information on XCM, please check out the [XCM](/builders/xcm/) section of the documentation. 

### Community Development

There is and will continue to be a large focus on growing the Moonriver and Moonbeam ecosystems, including deployments of integrations and partnerships and the addition of bounty programs.
