# Roadmap

Moonbeam is still being actively developed. 

In September 2020, we launched our [TestNet](/learn/platform/networks/overview/){target=_blank}, Moonbase Alpha. Since then we have performed significants upgrades on almost a monthly basis. You can check the milestones achieved by each update on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam/releases){target=_blank}.

In June 2021, Moonriver went [live on Kusama](https://moonbeam.network/announcements/moonriver-launch-kusama/){target=_blank}, making it the first live production level blockchain within the Moonbeam Network.

In December 2021, Moonbeam went [live on Polkadot](https://moonbeam.network/announcements/moonbeam-now-producing-blocks-polkadot/){target=_blank}, as one of the first parachains in the ecosystem.

You can check out what is currently in development, just launched, planned, and under consideration on the [Moonbeam & Moonriver Product Roadmap](https://roadmap.moonbeam.network/){target=_blank} site. From there, you can also submit feature requests and add your opinion on any of the open items to let us know what features are most important to you.
