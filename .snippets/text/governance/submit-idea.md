## Submit your Idea to the Community Forum {: #submitting-your-idea-to-the-forum }

Before diving into the steps for submitting a proposal, you'll want to get familiar with [Moonbeam's Community Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/){target=_blank}. It's highly recommended that you preface any proposal with a post on the forum to solicit feedback. You should allow a period of five days for the community to discuss and provide feedback on the Moonbeam Forum post before proceeding to submit the preimage and proposal.

To access the Moonbeam Community Forum, you must be a member of the [Moonbeam Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PfpUATX){target=_blank} community. You can then sign up to get access to the forum using your Discord credentials.

Once youâ€™re logged in, you can explore the latest discussions, join conversations, and create your own discussion for a proposal idea you may have. Before posting or commenting for the first time, be sure to familiarize yourself with the [FAQ](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/faq){target=_blank} to learn about the community guidelines.

When you're ready to create a post with the details of your proposal, you can head to the **Governance** page and click on **Democracy Proposals**.

From there, you can click on **Open Draft** and begin to draft your proposal using the template provided. Make sure to update the title of the post and add any of the optional tags, such as **Moonbeam** if the proposal is for the Moonbeam network. The title should follow the format as the pre-populated title: [Proposal: XX][Status: Idea] proposal title. For example, [Proposal: XX][Status: Idea] Register XC-20 xcMYTOK. The XX will need to be updated with the proposal ID once the proposal has been formally submitted on-chain.
