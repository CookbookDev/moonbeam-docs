 - **Lead-in Period** - the initial voting and discussion period for proposals. At this stage, proposals are in an undecided state until they pass the criteria for the given Track. The criteria includes:
    - **Prepare Period** - the minimum time the referendum needs to wait before it can progress to the next phase after submission
    - **Capacity** - limit for the number of referenda on a given Track that can be decided at once
    - **Decision Deposit** - the minimum deposit amount required for a referendum to progress to the decision phase after the end of the Lead-in Period. Since each Track has a defined Capacity, this deposit is larger than the submission deposit, and its goal is to mitigate spam 

    Different Tracks have different criteria parameters that are proportional to their level of Origin class. For example, more dangerous and privileged referenda will have more safeguards, higher thresholds, and longer consideration periods for approval
