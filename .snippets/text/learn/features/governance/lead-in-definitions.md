 - **Lead-in Period** — the initial proposal voting and discussion period. At this stage, proposals are in an undecided state until they pass some criteria for the given Track. The criteria include:
    - **Prepare Period** — the minimum time the referendum needs to wait before it can progress to the next phase after submission
    - **Capacity** — limit for the number of referenda on a given Track that can be decided at once
    - **Decision Deposit** — the minimum deposit amount required for a referendum to progress to the decision phase after the end of the Lead-in Period. Since each Track has a defined Capacity, this deposit is larger than the submission deposit, and its goal is to mitigate spam.
