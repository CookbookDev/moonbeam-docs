 - **Sovereign account** —  an account that each chain in the ecosystem has in the other chains. The account is owned by root and can only be used through SUDO (if available) or democracy (technical committee or referenda). The sovereign account normally signs XCM messages in other chains in the ecosystem
 - **Multilocation** —  a way to specify a point in the entire relay chain/parachain ecosystem from a given origin, either relative or absolute. For example, it can be used to specify a specific parachain, asset, account, or even a pallet inside a parachain. In general terms, a multilocation is defined with a `parents` and an `interior`. Parents refers to how many "hops" into a parent blockchain you need to take from a given origin. The interior refers to how many fields you need to define the target point. For example, to target a parachain with ID `1000` from another parachain, the multilocation would be `{ "parents": 1, "interior": { "X1": [{ "Parachain": 1000 }]}}`
