!!! note
    As of client v0.33.0, the `--ws-port` and `--ws-max-connections` flags have been deprecated and removed in favor of the `--rpc-port` and `--rpc-max-connections` flags for both RPC and WSS connections. The default port is `9944`, and the default maximum number of connections is set to 100.
