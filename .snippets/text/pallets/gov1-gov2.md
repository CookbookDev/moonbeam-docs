With the rollout of OpenGov (also referred to as Governance v2), the second phase of governance in Polkadot, several modifications have been introduced to the governance process. As a result, the governance system in Governance v1 uses the [Democracy Pallet](/builders/pallets-precompiles/pallets/democracy){target=_blank} and [Democracy Precompile](/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/democracy){target=_blank} for all governance-related functionality. In OpenGov, governance-related functionality is based on three new pallets and precompiles: the [Preimage Pallet](/builders/pallets-precompiles/pallets/preimage){target=_blank} and [Preimage Precompile](/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/preimage){target=_blank}, the [Referenda Pallet](/builders/pallets-precompiles/pallets/referenda){target=_blank} and [Referenda Precompile](/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/referenda){target=_blank}, and the [Conviction Voting Pallet](/builders/pallets-precompiles/pallets/conviction-voting){target=_blank} and [Conviction Voting Precompile](/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/conviction-voting){target=_blank}. **OpenGov has launched on Moonriver, and once it has been rigorously tested, a proposal will be made for it to be launched on Moonbeam. Until then, Moonbeam still uses Goverance v1.** The aforementioned precompiles are Solidity interfaces that enable you to perform governance functions using the Ethereum API.
