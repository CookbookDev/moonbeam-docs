The following code snippet goes through some examples of `Multilocation` structures, as they would need to be fed into the X-Tokens Precompile functions:

```js
// Multilocation targeting the relay chain or its asset from a parachain
{
    1, // parents = 1
    [] // interior = here
}

// Multilocation targeting Moonbase Alpha DEV token from another parachain
{
    1, // parents = 1
    // Size of array is 2, meaning is an X2 interior
    [
        "0x00000003E8", // Selector Parachain, ID = 1000 (Moonbase Alpha)
        "0x0403" // Pallet Instance = 3
    ]
}

// Multilocation targeting Alice's account on the Relay Chain from Moonbase Alpha
{
    1, // parents = 0
    // Size of array is 1, meaning is an X1 interior
    [
        "0x01c4db7bcb733e117c0b34ac96354b10d47e84a006b9e7e66a229d174e8ff2a06300" 
        // AccountKey32 Selector + Address in hex + Network = Any
    ]
}
```
