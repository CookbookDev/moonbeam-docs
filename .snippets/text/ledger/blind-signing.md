## Interact with Contracts Using your Ledger {: #interact-with-contracts-using-your-ledger } 

By default, Ledger devices don't admit a `data` field in the transaction object. Consequently, users can't deploy or interact with smart contracts.

However, if you want to use your Ledger hardware wallet for transactions related to smart contracts, you need to change a configuration parameter inside the app on your device. To do so, take the following steps:

 1. On your Ledger, open the Moonriver or Ethereum app
 2. Navigate to **Settings**
 3. Find the **Blind signing** page. It should state **NOT Enabled** at the bottom
 4. Select/validate the option to change its value to **Enabled**

!!! note
    This option is necessary to use your Ledger device to interact with ERC-20 token contracts that might live inside the Moonbeam ecosystem.
