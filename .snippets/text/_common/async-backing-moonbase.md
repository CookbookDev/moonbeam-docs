!!! note
    As of runtime 2800, [asynchronous backing](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-async-backing){target=\_blank} has been enabled on Moonbase Alpha. As a result, the target block time was reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, which may break some timing-based assumptions. Note that this is for Moonbase Alpha only.
