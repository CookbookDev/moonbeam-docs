Next you can take the following steps to modify the `hardhat.config.js` file and add Moonbase Alpha as a network:

1. Import plugins
2. Create a variable for your private key(s)

    !!! remember
        This is for demo purposes only. Never store your private key in a JavaScript file.

3. Inside the `module.exports`, you need to provide the Solidity version

    !!! note
        With the release of [Solidity v0.8.20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.20){target=_blank}, support for the Shanghai hard fork has been introduced, which includes `PUSH0` opcodes in the generated bytecode. Support for the `PUSH0` opcode on Moonbeam hasn't been rolled out yet. As such, if you'd like to use Solidity v0.8.20, you'll need to update the `solidity` config to use the London compiler:

        ```js
        solidity: {
          version: '0.8.20',
          settings: {
            evmVersion: 'london',
          },
        },
        ```

        If you attempt to use the default compiler of Solidity v0.8.20, you will see the following error:

        ```sh
        ProviderError: evm error: InvalidCode(Opcode(95))
        ```

4. Add the Moonbase Alpha network configuration. You can modify the `hardhat.config.js` file to use any of the Moonbeam networks:

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```js
        moonbeam: {
            url: '{{ networks.moonbeam.rpc_url }}', // Insert your RPC URL here
            chainId: {{ networks.moonbeam.chain_id }}, // (hex: {{ networks.moonbeam.hex_chain_id }}),
            accounts: [privateKey]
          },
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```js
        moonriver: {
            url: '{{ networks.moonriver.rpc_url }}', // Insert your RPC URL here
            chainId: {{ networks.moonriver.chain_id }}, // (hex: {{ networks.moonriver.hex_chain_id }}),
            accounts: [privateKey]
          },
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```js
        moonbase: {
            url: '{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}',
            chainId: {{ networks.moonbase.chain_id }}, // (hex: {{ networks.moonbase.hex_chain_id }}),
            accounts: [privateKey]
          },
        ```

    === "Moonbeam Dev Node"

        ```js
        dev: {
            url: '{{ networks.development.rpc_url }}',
            chainId: {{ networks.development.chain_id }}, // (hex: {{ networks.development.hex_chain_id }}),
            accounts: [privateKey]
          },
        ```
