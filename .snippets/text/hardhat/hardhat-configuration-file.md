Next you can take the following steps to modify the `hardhat.config.js` file and add Moonbase Alpha as a network:

1. Import plugins. The Hardhat Ethers plugin comes out of the box with Hardhat, so you don't need to worry about installing it yourself
2. Import the `secrets.json` file
3. Inside the `module.exports`, you need to provide the Solidity version

    !!! note
        With the release of [Solidity v0.8.20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.20){target=_blank}, support for the Shanghai hard fork has been introduced, which includes `PUSH0` opcodes in the generated bytecode. Support for the `PUSH0` opcode on Moonbeam hasn't been rolled out yet. As such, if you'd like to use Solidity v0.8.20, you'll need to update the `solidity` config to use the London compiler:

        ```js
        solidity: {
          version: '0.8.20',
          settings: {
            evmVersion: 'london',
          },
        },
        ```

        If you attempt to use the default compiler of Solidity v0.8.20, you will see the following error:

        ```
        ProviderError: evm error: InvalidCode(Opcode(95))
        ```

4. Add the Moonbase Alpha network configuration
