In this section, you'll create a script that uses the Solidity compiler to output the bytecode and interface (ABI) for the `Incrementer.sol` contract. To get started, you can create a `compile.js` file by running:

```
touch compile.js
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Import the `fs` and `solc` packages
2. Using the `fs.readFileSync` function, you'll read and save the file contents of `Incrementer.sol` to `source`
3. Build the `input` object for the Solidity compiler by specifying the `language`, `sources`, and `settings` to be used
4. Using the `input` object, you can compile the contract using `solc.compile`
5. Extract the compiled contract file and export it to be used in the deployment script

```js
--8<-- 'code/web3-contract-local/compile.js'
```

!!! note
    With the release of [Solidity v0.8.20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.20){target=_blank}, support for the Shanghai hard fork has been introduced, which includes `PUSH0` opcodes in the generated bytecode. Support for the `PUSH0` opcode on Moonbeam hasn't been rolled out yet. As such, it is recommended to use `evmVersion: 'london'` under the `settings` config for the time being to switch to the London compiler.

    If you attempt to use the default compiler of Solidity v0.8.20, you will see the following error:

    ```
    {'code': -32603, 'message': 'evm error: InvalidCode(Opcode(95))', 'data': '0x'}
    ```
