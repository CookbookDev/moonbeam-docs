#  Cross-Chain Assets Precompile

![Cross-Chain Assets Precompiled Contracts Banner](/images/builders/tools/precompiles/xc20/xc20-banner.png)

## Introduction {: #introduction } 

The [Cross-Consensus Message (XCM)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain) format defines how messages can be sent between blockchains. This format opens the door to transfer messages and assets between Moonbeam and the Relay Chain or other parachains.

Cross-chain assets on Moonbeam are one-to-one representations of the origin chain’s native tokens and are known as XC-20s. For example, Kusama's KSM representation will be known as XC-KSM. XC-20s allow users to bring their tokens to Moonbeam and interact with them through a standard ERC-20 interface via the [assets precompile](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam/blob/master/precompiles/assets-erc20/ERC20.sol).

Under the hood, this is made possible by Substate’s assets pallet, which is coded in Rust. However, no knowledge of Rust is necessary as the assets precompile enables Solidity developers to use Substrate functions to interact with cross-chain assets through an easy-to-use and familiar format. Please note that that the precompile does not support transfers. This is intentionally done to stay as close as possible to the standard ERC-20 interface. <TODO: link to other XCM page with more information>

This guide will show you how to retrieve the available cross-chain assets and their precompile addresses on the Moonbase Alpha TestNet using Polkadot.js Apps. As well as how to interact with the asset precompile using Remix.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites } 

To approve a spend or transfer assets via the asset precompile, you will need:

- [MetaMask installed and connected to the Moonbase Alpha](/tokens/connect/metamask/) TestNet
- Create or have two accounts on Moonbase Alpha
- At least one of the accounts will need to be funded with `DEV` tokens. You can obtain tokens for testing purposes from the Moonbase Alpha [faucet](/builders/get-started/moonbase/#get-tokens/)

## The ERC-20 Interface {: #the-erc20-interface }

The [ERC20.sol](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam/blob/master/precompiles/assets-erc20/ERC20.sol) interface on Moonbeam follows the [EIP-20 Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) which is the standard API interface for tokens within smart contracts. The standard defines the required functions and events that a token contract must implement to be interoperable with different applications.

## Retrieve List of Cross-Chain Assets

To fetch a list of the cross-chain assets currently available on the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, head to [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fwss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/explorer){target=_blank} and make sure you're connected to Moonbase Alpha. Then click on the **Developer** tab and select **Chain State** from the dropdown. To query the available cross-chain assets, you can follow these steps:

1. From the **selected state query** dropdown, choose **assets**
2. Select the **asset** extinsic
3. Disable the **include option** slider
4. Send the query by clicking on the **+** button

![Fetch list of cross-chain assets](/images/builders/tools/precompiles/xc20/xc20-1.png)

The result will display the asset ID along with some additional information for all of the registered cross-chain assets on Moonbase Alpha. To quickly get more information about a specific asset such as the name and symbol of the asset, you can use the **metadata** extrinsic to return metadata for the asset:

1. From the **selected state query** dropdown, choose **assets**
2. Select the **metadata** extinsic
3. Enable the **include option** slider
4. Enter in the asset ID that was returned from calling the **asset** extrinsic. Please note that if you copy and paste the asset ID with the commas, the commas will automatically be removed and the number might be cut off. Make sure it's the exact same number as the ID. For this example, you can use asset ID `42259045809535163221576417993425387648`
4. Send the query by clicking on the **+** button 

![Get asset metadata](/images/builders/tools/precompiles/xc20/xc20-2.png)

With the results from the metadata, you can see that the asset ID corresponds to the VUNIT asset.

## Calculate Precompile Addresses

Now that you have retrieved a list of the available cross-chain assets, before you can interact with them via the precompile, you need to derive the precompile address from the asset ID.

The cross-chain asset address is calculated using the following equation:

```
address = "0XFFFFFFFF" + DecimalToHex(AssetId)
```

Given the above equation, the first step is to take the u128 representation of the asset ID and convert it to a hex value. You can use your search engine of choice to look up a simple tool for converting decimals to hex values. For asset ID `42259045809535163221576417993425387648`, the hex value is `1FCACBD218EDC0EBA20FC2308C778080`.

Since Ethereum addresses are 40 characters long, you will need to prepend `F`s to the hex value until the address has 40 characters. 

The hex value that was already calculated is 32 characters long, so appending 8 `F`s will give you the 40 character address you need to interact with the asset precompile. For this example, the full address is `0xFFFFFFFF1FCACBD218EDC0EBA20FC2308C778080`.

Asset precompiles can only fall between `0xFFFFFFFF00000000000000000000000000000000` and `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`.

Now, you can use the precompile address to interact with the asset like you would with any other ERC-20 in Remix.

## Interact with the Precompile Using Remix {: #interact-with-the-precompile-using-remix } 

You can interact with the cross-chain asset precompile using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/). First, you will need to add the ERC20 interface to Remix:

1. Get a copy of [ERC20.sol](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam/blob/master/precompiles/assets-erc20/ERC20.sol) 
2. Paste the file contents into a Remix file named **IERC20.sol**

![Load the interface in Remix](/images/builders/tools/precompiles/xc20/xc20-3.png)

### Compile the Contract {: #compile-the-contract } 

Once you have the ERC20 interface loaded in Remix, you will need to compile it:

1. Click on the **Compile** tab, second from top
2. Compile the **IER20.sol** file

![Compiling IERC20.sol](/images/builders/tools/precompiles/xc20/xc20-4.png)

If the interface was compiled successfully, you will see a green checkmark next to the **Compile** tab.

### Access the Contract {: #access-the-contract } 

Instead of deploying the ERC-20 precompile, you will access the interface given the address of the asset precompile:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix. Please note the precompiled contract is already deployed
2. Make sure **Injected Web3** is selected in the **Environment** dropdown. Once you select **Injected Web3**, you might be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix
3. Make sure the correct account is displayed under **Account**
4. Ensure **IERC20 - IERC20.sol** is selected in the **Contract** dropdown. Since this is a precompiled contract, there is no need to deploy any code. Instead we are going to provide the address of the precompile in the **At Address** Field
5. Provide the address of the asset precompile calculated in the [Calculate Precompile Address](#calculate-precompile-address) section, `0xFFFFFFFF1FCACBD218EDC0EBA20FC2308C778080`, and click **At Address**

![Access the address](/images/builders/tools/precompiles/xc20/xc20-5.png)

!!! note
    Optionally, you can checksum the asset precompile address by going to your search engine of choice and searching for a tool to checksum the address. Once the address has been checksummed, you can use it in the **At Address** field instead. 

The **IERC20** asset precompile will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**. Now you can feel free to call any of the standard ERC-20 functions to get information about the asset or transfer the asset. 

![Interact with the precompile functions](/images/builders/tools/precompiles/xc20/xc20-6.png)

To learn how to interact with each of the functions, you can check out the [ERC-20 Precompile](/builders/tools/precompiles/erc20) guide and modify it for interacting with the asset precompile.
