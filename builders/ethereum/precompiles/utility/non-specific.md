# Non-Network Specific Precompiled Smart Contracts

## Introduction {: #introduction }

A precompiled contract, or simply precompile, is a set of programmed functionality that it is hard coded into the blockchain client itself. Precompiles are designed to perform computationally heavy tasks, such as cryptographic processes like hashing. Moving these functionalities to the blockchain client serves the dual purposes of making the computation more efficient than using a traditional smart contract and ensuring everyone has access to the complete and correct set of processes and algorithms required for the blockchain to operate properly.

Precompile functionality is bundled and shared under a smart contract address which allows interactions similar to a traditional smart contract. There are some precompiled contracts that are not specific to Ethereum nor to Moonbeam, but are supported for use in your Moonbeam application. In this guide, you will learn how to use and/or verify these precompiles.
