# Get Started with Bobabase

## Introduction
Boba is a compute-focused Layer 2 (L2) built on the Optimistic Rollup developed by [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/){target=_blank}. Boba augments the compute capabilities of EVM-compatible blockchains with a variety of features including [Turing hybrid compute](https://docs.boba.network/turing/turing){target=_blank}. After launching on Ethereum, Boba has brought its Layer 2 scaling solution to Moonbeam.

## Connect MetaMask {: #connect-metamask }

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to Bobabase:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="bobabase">Connect MetaMask</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will popup asking for permission to add Bobabase as a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network to Bobabase.

If you do not have MetaMask installed, or would like to follow a tutorial to get started, please check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam using MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/) guide.

## Get Tokens with the Faucet {: #get-tokens-with-the-faucet } 

Bobabase allows fee payment in either DEV or testnet BOBA. Testnet BOBA is distributed via a Tweet-authenticated faucet on [Bobabase Gateway](https://gateway.bobabase.boba.network/){target=_blank}, a home for your Boba Layer 2 activities akin to [apps.moonbeam.network](https://Apps.Moonbeam.Network/){target=_blank}.
