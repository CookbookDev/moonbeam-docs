## Introduction 

Write 2-3 paragraphs about Axelar and how it works. These should be long-lived, meaning they will not require changes in the future.

Axelar delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3. Secure means Axelar is built on proof-of-stake, the battle-tested approach used by Avalanche, Cosmos, Eth2, etc. Cross-chain communication means you can build a complete experience for your users that lets them interact with any asset, any application, on any chain with one click.
