# LayerZero Protocol

![LayerZero Moonbeam banner](/images/builders/integrations/bridges/layerzero/layerzero-banner.png)

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/){target=_blank} delivers secure omnichain interoperability for Web3. It consists of an Oracle actor and a Relayer actor that work separately to provide secure messages from one chain to another. LayerZero's infrastructure enables dApp users to interact with any asset or application, on any connected chain, with one click.

LayerZero is a transport layer that enables asset transfer with low-level communication primitives. dApps utilized LayerZero are known as User Applications, whose messages are relayed across chains by a Relayer, and whose messages are verified on the destination chain by an Oracle's block headers. Take a look at the tech stack diagram below and their [conceptual documentation](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/faq/messaging-properties){target=_blank} for more details.

## Getting Started {: #getting-started }

There are a couple of resources to get you started building cross-chain applications with LayerZero:

- **[Developer documentation](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/){target=_blank}** - for technical guides
- **[Stargate](https://stargate.finance/){target=_blank}** - a bridging UI that uses LayerZero, built by the Stargate team

## Contracts {: #contracts }

See the list of LayerZero contracts deployed to Moonbeam, and the networks connected to Moonbeam through LayerZero.
