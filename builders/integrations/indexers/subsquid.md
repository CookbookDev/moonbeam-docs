# Indexing Moonbeam with Subsquid

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Subsquid](https://subsquid.io){target=_blank} is a data network that allows rapid and cost-efficient retrieval of blockchain data from 100+ chains using Subsquidâ€™s decentralized data lake and open-source SDK. In very simple terms, Subsquid can be thought of as an ETL (extract, transform, and load) tool with a GraphQL server included. It enables comprehensive filtering, pagination, and even full-text search capabilities.

Subsquid has native and full support for both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Substrate data. Since Moonbeam is a Substrate-based smart contact platform that is EVM-compatible, Subsquid can be used to index both EVM and Substrate-based data. Subsquid offers a Substrate Archive and Processor and an EVM Archive and Processor. The Substrate Archive and Processor can be used to index both Substrate and EVM data. This allows developers to extract on-chain data from any of the Moonbeam networks and process EVM logs as well as Substrate entities (events, extrinsics, and storage items) in one single project and serve the resulting data with one single GraphQL endpoint. If you exclusively want to index EVM data, it is recommended to use the EVM Archive and Processor.

This quick-start guide will show you how to create Substrate and EVM projects with Subsquid and configure it to index data on Moonbeam.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To get started with Subsquid, you'll need to have the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/){target=_blank} version 16 or newer
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/){target=_blank}
- [Squid CLI](https://docs.subsquid.io/squid-cli/installation/){target=_blank}

!!! note
    The squid template is not compatible with `yarn`, so you'll need to use `npm` instead.

## Index Substrate Data on Moonbeam {: #index-substrate-calls-events }

To get started indexing Substrate data on Moonbeam, you'll need to create a Subsquid project and configure it for Moonbeam by taking the following steps:

1. Create a Subsquid project based on the Substrate template by running:

    ```bash
    sqd init INSERT_SQUID_NAME --template substrate
    ```

    For more information on getting started with this template, please check out the [Quickstart: Substrate chains](https://docs.subsquid.io/quickstart/quickstart-substrate/){target=_blank} guide on Subsquid's documentation site.

2. Install dependencies by running: 

    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3. To configure your Subsquid project to run on Moonbeam, you'll need to update the `typegen.json` file. The `typegen.json` file is responsible for generating TypeScript interface classes for your data. Depending on the network you're indexing data on, the `specVersions` value in the `typegen.json` file should be configured as follows:

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```json
        "specVersions": "https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonbeam-mainnet",
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```json
        "specVersions": "https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonriver-mainnet",
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```json
        "specVersions": "https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonbase-testnet",
        ```

4. Modify the `src/processor.ts` file, which is where squids instantiate the processor, configure it, and attach handler functions. The processor fetches historical on-chain data from an [Archive](https://docs.subsquid.io/archives/overview/){target=_blank}, which is a specialized data lake. You'll need to configure your processor to pull data from the Archive that corresponds to the [network](https://docs.subsquid.io/substrate-indexing/supported-networks/){target=_blank} you are indexing data on:

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```ts
        const processor = new SubstrateBatchProcessor();
        processor.setDataSource({
          chain: '{{ networks.moonbeam.rpc_url }}',
          // Resolves to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonbeam-mainnet'
          archive: lookupArchive('moonbeam', {type: 'Substrate', release: 'ArrowSquid'}),
        });
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```ts
        const processor = new SubstrateBatchProcessor();
        processor.setDataSource({
          chain: '{{ networks.moonriver.rpc_url }}',
          // Resolves to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonriver-mainnet'
          archive: lookupArchive('moonriver', {type: 'Substrate', release: 'ArrowSquid'}),
        });
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```ts
        const processor = new SubstrateBatchProcessor();
        processor.setDataSource({
          chain: '{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}',
          // Resolves to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonbase-testnet'
          archive: lookupArchive('moonbase', {type: 'Substrate', release: 'ArrowSquid'}),
        });

        ```

5. There's one more quick change that we need to make. The Subsquid Substrate template is configured to process Substrate account types, but Moonbeam uses Ethereum-style accounts. In the `getTransferEvents` function, remove the ss58 encoding of the `from` and `to` fields. 

In an unmodified Substrate template, the `from` and `to` fields are ss58 encoded as shown:

```ts
from: ss58.codec('kusama').encode(rec.from),
to: ss58.codec('kusama').encode(rec.to),
```

After removing the ss58 encoding the two lines are:

```ts
from: rec.from, 
to: rec.to, 
```

And that's all you have to do to configure your Subsquid project to index Substrate data on Moonbeam! Now you can update the `schema.graphql`, `typgen.json`, and `src/processor.ts` files to index the data you need for your project!

## Index Ethereum Data on Moonbeam {: #index-ethereum-contracts }

To get started indexing EVM data on Moonbeam, you'll need to create a Subsquid project and configure it for Moonbeam by taking the following steps:

1. You can create a Subsquid project for EVM data by using the generic [EVM template](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/squid-evm-template){target=_blank} or you can use the [ABI template](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/squid-abi-template){target=_blank} for indexing data related to a specific contract:

    === "EVM"

        ```bash
        sqd init INSERT_SQUID_NAME --template evm
        ```

    === "ABI"

        ```bash
        sqd init INSERT_SQUID_NAME --template abi
        ```

    For more information on getting started with both of these templates, please check out the following Subsquid docs:
      
      - [Quickstart: EVM chains](https://docs.subsquid.io/quickstart/quickstart-ethereum/){target=_blank}
      - [Quickstart: generate from ABI](https://docs.subsquid.io/quickstart/quickstart-abi/){target=_blank}

2. Install dependencies by running: 

    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3. Modify the `src/processor.ts` file, which is where squids instantiate the processor, configure it, and attach handler functions. The processor fetches historical on-chain data from an [Archive](https://docs.subsquid.io/archives/overview/){target=_blank}, which is a specialized data lake. You'll need to configure your processor to pull data from the Archive that corresponds to the [network](https://docs.subsquid.io/evm-indexing/supported-networks/){target=_blank} you are indexing data on:

    === "Moonbeam"

        ```ts
        const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor();
        processor.setDataSource({
          chain: '{{ networks.moonbeam.rpc_url }}',
          // Resolves to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonbeam-mainnet'
          archive: lookupArchive('moonbeam', { type: 'EVM' })
        });
        ```

    === "Moonriver"

        ```ts
        const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor();
        processor.setDataSource({
          chain: '{{ networks.moonriver.rpc_url }}',
          // Resolves to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonriver-mainnet'
          archive: lookupArchive('moonriver', { type: 'EVM' }),
        });
        ```

    === "Moonbase Alpha"

        ```ts
        const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor();
        processor.setDataSource({
          chain: '{{ networks.moonbase.rpc_url }}',
          // Resolves to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonbase-testnet'
          archive: lookupArchive('moonbase', { type: 'EVM' }),
        });

        ```

4. Launch Postgres and detach by running:

    ```bash
    sqd up
    ```

5. Inspect and run the processor:

    ```bash
    sqd process
    ```

6. Open a separate terminal window in the same directory, then start the GraphQL server. 

    ```bash
    sqd serve
    ```

7. You can query your template EVM squid with the below sample query. If you've modified the template EVM squid to index different data, you'll need to modify this query accordingly.

    ```graphql
    query MyQuery {
      burns(orderBy: value_DESC) {
        address
        block
        id
        txHash
        value
      }
    }
    ```


And that's all you have to do to configure your Subsquid project to index EVM data on Moonbeam! Now you can update the `schema.graphql`, `typegen.json`, and `src/processor.ts` files to index the data you need for your project!
