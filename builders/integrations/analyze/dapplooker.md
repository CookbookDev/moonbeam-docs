# Analyze Moonriver/Moonbeam with Dapplooker

![Dapplooker Banner](/images/builders/integrations/analyze/dapplooker/subquery-banner.png)

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Developers on Moonriver and Moonbeam (once it launches) can use the [Dapplooker](https://dapplooker.com/) platform to analyze their on-chain data. This integration gives projects the ability to create charts and dashboards to **track their smart contracts** and provide feedback on performance and adoption.

Moonbeam is a new Polkadot smart contract platform that makes it easy to build natively interoperable blockchain applications. [Dapplooker](https://dapplooker.com/) is the perfect complement to the Moonbeam and Moonriver network by helping users make sense of smart contracts without having to rely on an engineer or analyst.
