# Getting Started with Dapplooker Platform

![Dapplooker Banner](/images/builders/integrations/analyze/dapplooker/dapplooker-banner.png)

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Developers on Moonriver and Moonbeam can use the [Dapplooker](https://dapplooker.com/) platform to analyze their on-chain data and run SQL queries. The integration gives projects the ability to create charts and dashboards to **track their smart contracts** and provide feedback on performance and adoption.

Dapplooker analytics platform complements Moonbeam/Moonriver network by helping users make sense of smart contracts without having to rely on an engineer or analyst. Dapplooker’s intuitive Visual SQL helps browse smart contract data in tabular form and write SQL queries using easy to use editor. Users can create, fork and share dashboards with everyone.

This guide will cover all of the details needed to register your project with Dapplooker platform and how to build analytics using SQL editor. This guide can be adapted for use on Moonbeam or Moonriver or Moonbase Alpha.
