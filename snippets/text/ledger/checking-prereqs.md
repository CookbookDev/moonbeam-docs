## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites } 

Before you get started, update [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download) to the latest version available. Also, make sure you've your Ledger hardware wallet device running the latest firmware. The Ledger support website offers tutorials on how to update the firmware of both [Ledger Nano S](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-Ledger-Nano-S-firmware) and [Ledger Nano X](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013349800-Update-Ledger-Nano-X-firmware) devices.

At the time of writing, the following versions were used:

 - [Ledger Live 2.35.1](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020773319-What-s-new-in-Ledger-Live-?docs=true)
 - [Ledger Nano S firmware v2.0.0](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010446000-Ledger-Nano-S-firmware-release-notes?docs=true)
 - [Ledger Nano X firmware v2.0.1](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014980580-Ledger-Nano-X-firmware-release-notes?docs=true)

In addition, you'll need MetaMask as an intermediary between your Ledger device and Moonbeam. Make sure that your MetaMask is [connected to Moonbeam](/tokens/connect/metamask/). 

As of [MetaMask version 10.5.0](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-and-ledger-integration-fixed/), connecting your Ledger device with MetaMask on Chrome is easy again. You just need to have the latest version of MetaMask installed.
