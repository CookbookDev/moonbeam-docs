###Collators
One of the key network participants needed to support Parachains within the Polkadot Network.  In Moonbeam Collators are the nodes that are responsible for block production and for submitting produced blocks up to the Polkadot Relay Chain for finalization.

###Parachains
A blockchain which is connected to Polkadot.  Parachains receive shared security from Polkadot and the ability to interact with other Parachains on the Polkadot network.

###Polkadot
A network of connected blockchains that provides shared security and the ability to interact between chains.  Polkadot is built using the Substrate development framework.  Chains that connect to Polkadot are called Parachains.

###Relay Chain
The backbone blockchain supporting the Polkadot network.  Parachains connect to the Relay Chain and use it for shared security and message passing.  Validators on the Relay Chain help secure the parachains.

###Smart Contract
A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need in trusted intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs, fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract].

###Substrate
A Rust based blockchain development framework created by Parity Technologies based on their experience implementing multiple blockchain clients.  Substrate comes with many modules and functionalities that are needed when you are building a blockchain including p2p network, consensus mechanisms, staking, cryptocurrency, on chain governance modules, etc.  It dramatically reduces the time and engineering effort required to implement a blockchain.
