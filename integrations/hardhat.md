# Building with Hardhat on Moonbase Alpha

## Introduction
In this guide, we will cover how to use Hardhat to compile, deploy and debug Ethereum smart contracts on Moonbase Alpha.

## Checking Prerequisites
As always, check that Node.js has been installed on your machine (we'll go for v14.x) and npm. You can do this by running in your terminal:

=== "Ubuntu"

    ```
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
    ```

    ```
    sudo apt install -y nodejs
    ```

=== "Mac OS"

      If you don‚Äôt have `Homebrew` installed yet, follow the instructions on their [website](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation). After installing Homebrew, open terminal and type:

    ```
    brew install node
    ```

    Homebrew will run through the installation process. Once finished, you should have both Node.js and `Node Package Manager (npm)` installed.

=== "Windows"

      Download the Node.js `Windows Installer` from the Node.js official [Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

      Open the Windows Installer file and run through the installation process. Once finished, you should have both Node.js and `Node Package Manager (npm)` installed.

We can verify that everything installed correctly by querying the version for each package:

```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```

As of the writing of this guide, versions used were 14.6.0 and 6.14.6, respectively. 

Also, you will need the following:

-  Have MetaMask installed and [connected to Moonbase](/getting-started/testnet/metamask/)
-  Have an account with funds, which you can get from [Mission Control](/getting-started/testnet/faucet/)

Once all requirements have been met, you are ready to build with Hardhat.

## Starting a Hardhat Project

To start a new project, create a directory for it:
```
mkdir tutorial && cd tutorial
```
Then, initialize the project by running:
```
npm init -y
```
You will notice a newly created `package.json`, which will continue to grow as you install project dependencies through `npm install`.

To get started with Hardhat we will install it in our newly created project directory:
```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
Once installed, run:
```
npx hardhat
```
This will create create a Hardhat config file (`hardhat.config.js`) in our project directory.

!!! note
      `npx` is used to run executables installed locally in your project. Although Hardhat can be installed globally we recommend installing locally in each project so that you can control the version on a project by project basis.
    
After running the command, go ahead and choose `Create an empty hardhat.config.js`:

## Writing the Smart Contract

We are going to store our contract in the `contracts` directory. Go ahead and create it:

```
mkdir contracts && cd contracts
```

Our simple smart contract will be called Box: it will let people store a value that can be later retrieved. 

We will save this file as `contracts/Box.sol`: 

```solidity
// contracts/Box.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.1;

contract Box {
    uint256 private value;

    // Emitted when the stored value changes
    event ValueChanged(uint256 newValue);

    // Stores a new value in the contract
    function store(uint256 newValue) public {
        value = newValue;
        emit ValueChanged(newValue);
    }

    // Reads the last stored value
    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}
```

## Compiling Solidity

Our contract, `Box.sol`, uses Solidity 0.8.1. We need to configure hardhat to use the appropriate version of `solc` inside `hardhat.config.js`: 

```js
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.1",
};
```
After saving the file, we are ready to compile:

```
npx hardhat compile

Downloading compiler 0.8.1
Compiling 1 file with 0.8.1
Compilation finished successfully
```

## Deploying the contract to Moonbase Alpha

After compilation an `artifacts` directory was created: it holds the bytecode and metadata of the contract, which are .json files. It‚Äôs a good idea to add this directory to your `.gitignore`.

_Next Sections WIP_

- Create and fund a Moonbase account (will refer to existing tutorial)
- Updating hardhat config to connect to Moonbase Alpha
- Deploy the contract to Moonbase Alpha
- Interact with the contract through hardhat console
- Closing remarks and a segway into OpenZeppelin Contracts + Hardhat
