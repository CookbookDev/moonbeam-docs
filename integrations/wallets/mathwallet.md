## Introduction



Currently, MetaMask can be configured to connect to two networks: a Moonbeam standalone node, or the [Moonbase Alpha TestNet](/networks/testnet/). 

## Connect MathWallet to Moonbeam

In this part, we'll go through the process of connecting MathWallet to Moonbase Alpha. 

First, you need install the MathWallet browser extension installed, which you can get from their [website](https://mathwallet.org/en-us/).

With the browser extension installed, open it and set a password for our wallet.
