## Introduction

OpenZeppelin contracts have become a standard in the industry. They help developers minimize risk, as their libraries of smart contracts are battle-tested for Ethereum and other blockchains. It includes the most used implementations of ERC standards, and often appear in guides and tutorials around the community.

This guide walks through the process of deploying three of the most common ERC standards using OpenZeppelin code: ERC20 (fungible tokens), ERC721 (non-fungible tokens) and ERC1155 (multi-token standard). All token contracts are deployed in the Moonbase Alpha Testnet.
