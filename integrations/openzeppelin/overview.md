## Introduction

OpenZeppelin is well known in the Ethereum developer community as their set of audited smart contracts are a standard in the industry. For example, most of the tutorials that show developers how to deploy an ERC20 token use OpenZeppelin contracts.

You can find more information about OpenZeppelin in their [website](https://openzeppelin.com/) or [documentation site](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/openzeppelin/).

As part of Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility features, OpenZeppelin products can be seamlessly used in our Moonbase Alpha TestNet. This page will provide information on different OpenZeppelin solutions that you can test with Moonbeam.
