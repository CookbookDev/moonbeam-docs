# Moonbeam TestNet Faucet

Tokens on the Moonbeam TestNet, named DEV, will be issued on-demand. Currently, there are two ways you can get access to this token.


## Discord

To request tokens automatically, we've created a Discord bot (named Mission Control :sunglasses:) that will automatically send a maximum of 10 DEV tokens per hour (per Discord user) when you enter your address. You can check it out on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/3rgpMmX).
 
Under the category _Miscellaneous_ you will find our bots channel. Enter the following message, replacing `<enter-address-here->` with your H160 address:
 
```
!faucet send <enter-address-here->
```
 
## Manual Procedure

For token requests of more than the limited account allowed by our Discord bot, contact us directly via our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/3rgpMmX). We are happy to provided the tokens needed for your applications.
