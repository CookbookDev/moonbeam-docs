# Moonbase Alpha Faucet

Tokens on Moonbase Alpha, named DEV, will be issued on demand. Currently, there are two ways you can get access to this token: through a Discord bot, or manually.

### Discord - Mission Control

To request tokens automatically, we've created a Discord bot (named Mission Control :sunglasses:) that will automatically send a maximum of 10 DEV tokens per hour (per Discord user) when you enter your address. You can check it out on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/3rgpMmX).
 
Under the category "Miscellaneous", you will find our AlphaNet bot channel.

To check your balance, enter the following message, replacing `<enter-address-here->` with your H160 address:

```
!balance <enter-address-here->
```

To get DEV tokens, enter the following message, replacing `<enter-address-here->` with your H160 address:
 
```
!faucet send <enter-address-here->
```

Mission Control will send you 10 DEV tokens and display your current account balance. Remember that Mission Control is limited to dispense once per Discord user per hour.

### Manual Procedure

For token requests of more than the limited account allowed by our Discord bot, contact a moderator directly via our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/3rgpMmX). We are happy to provide the tokens needed to test your applications.
