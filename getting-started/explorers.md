## Available Block Explorers  

The Moonbeam team is currently working on onboarding a specialized solution that would allow to navigate the EVM, as well as, the Substrate layer of the blockchain.

You can access the Moonbeam TestNet, or a standalone running Moonbeam node, through the following block explorers: 

###Expedition Explorer (Ethereum)

Navigate to [https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/](https://moonbeam-explorer.netlify.app/) to access the current state of the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. The explorer is also available in Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Korean. 

###Polkadot.JS Apps (Susbtrate)

Navigate to [Polkadot/Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fwss.testnet.moonbeam.network#/explorer) to view and interact with the Substrate layer of Moonbase Alpha.
