#Links

* [Substrate.dev](https://substrate.dev/) - Starting point for learning about [Substrate](/resources/glossary/#substrate), which is a Rust-based framework for developing blockchains.  Moonbeam is developed using Substrate and uses many of the modules that come with Substrate.
* [Polkadot.network](https://polkadot.network/) - Learn about Polkadot, the vision behind the network, how the system works including staking, governance, etc.
* [Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps) - A web-based interface for interacting with substrate based nodes including Moonbeam.
* [Solidity Docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) - Solidity is the main smart contract programming language supported by Ethereum and Moonbeam.  The Solidity docs site is very comprehensive.
* [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - Web-based IDE for Solidity smart contract development that is compatible with Moonbeam.
* [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) - Development tools for Solidity, including debugging, testing, and automated deployment that is compatible with Moonbeam.
