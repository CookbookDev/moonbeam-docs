# Roadmap

Moonbeam is still being actively developed. 

On September 2020, we launched our [TestNet](/networks/overview/). Since then, we have performed significant upgrades on almost a monthly basis. You can check the milestones achieved by each update in their corresponding [release notes](/networks/moonbase/#release-notes).

On June 2021, Moonriver went [live on Kusama](https://moonbeam.network/announcements/moonriver-launch-kusama/), making it the first live production level blockchain within the Moonbeam Network.

The rough roadmap beyond that is to launch Moonbeam on the Polkadot MainNet by the end of 2021. However, this milestone is still dependant on the enabling of Parachains in the Polkadot relay chain.
