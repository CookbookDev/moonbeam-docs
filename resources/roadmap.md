#Roadmap
Moonbeam is currently pre-alpha software. We are working on the implementation of the minimum feature set, which will be needed to launch a [TestNet](/resources/networks/) in Q3 2020. The rough roadmap beyond that is to launch on Kusama in Q4 2020 and on the Polkadot MainNet in Q1 2021.

Our current focus is on making sure the Moonbeam EVM and Web3 compatibility features are feature complete. A big part of this effort is the completion of the Web3 grant we are working on to implement a Web3 compatible RPC API.  Details of the grant can be found [here](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/web3-compatible-api.md).  We expect to complete work related to this grant in July 2020.

We have several critical components in our backlog that plan to work on next, including the implementation of an Ethereum-compatible account system in Moonbeam and functionality to power collator mechanics and incentives in Moonbeam.
